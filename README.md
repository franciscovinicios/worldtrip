## Challenge description

<p>
  In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where you have two main goals. The first is to develop the entire interface using Chakra UI
 as a base. The other is that you should work on the responsiveness of the application (and this is where your creativity can shine even more).
</p>


## Tech Stack

The following tools were used in the construction of the project:

-   **React**
-   **React Icons**
-   **TypeScript**
-   **NextJs**
-   **Prismic CMS**
-   **Sass**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
